# Teamwork Questionnaire for Josh Burris

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is immediate, but email is also fast. You can reach me anytime of day, usually starting at 11:00am.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think we'll make a great website and work well together as teammates.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would like to make everyone happy even if we don't all agree on everything because I think that's what makes a team work.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * My team might be too busy or not want to finish or make things look nice, because this semester is also about writing clean code.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I hope people are willing to put in the work to get an "A." If they don't want to then I think they're being lazy, unless they really can't for other reasons then that's okay.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think everyone should contribute evenly even if some people want to push to grade to the next level.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * At least an hour or two a day, but that doesn't have to be all at once. It's hard to only work on something for an hour and then come back to it.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we all decide as a group, maybe try to play to people's strengths is that's a thing?
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If there's no reason other then they simply didn't do it then they get a lower grade and they still have to make up that work for next time.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * As long as we're not putting too much time into something that's not worth it and not needing absolute perfection then I think we'll be fine.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * If everyone is basically working at separate times we can still communicate and ask questions on Slack.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think that would be a good idea.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once or twice a week at the most.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * That's probably a good idea, unless it's just small decisions.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * If the one person simply won't budge for whatever reason, even if we ask Dave for suggestions, then the majority should probably rule.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Ask them to step back and allow other people to take on responsibilities.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Ask other people if they can pick up some extra work because I'm feeling overwhelmed. I hope everyone in this project will be accomidating to other people's needs and feelings.
