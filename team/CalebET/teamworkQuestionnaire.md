# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Caleb Tong_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, email, slack
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Amazing things
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Being honest about any conflict that may arrise and confront it ASAP
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Procrastination, not being in the mood, active at different times, etc.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Tell them, that it's better to aim for an A, and get a B, then aim for a B and get a C
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Of course, I mean I don't know all the work needed to get an "A", so there will definately be unequal amount of work deligated, but I do ask for communication if any feeling of discomfort arises.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Hopefully, 5 hours __at least__. It's a rough guestimate, but it's like 1 hour a day for the weekdays. If you know you need more time, give yourself 10 hours to set aside
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * If we know everything needed to complete it, by dice. Else by expertise. If coincide with the same people, scissors, paper, stone, then keep record so that next time same things arises, alternate with the other.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * It's the fault of the whole team. But it will be such that everyone has done what is needed 1 week before the assignment is due, so that we have time to pick up the slack if any emergency cases arises.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We will have to come to a conclusion there and then, either way. If possible, give in to one and take turns for who to follow next assignment.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Ask them honestly, keep track of their habits if possible, and try to consult what is the best option with the information I have then.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, at least set a time, so if we don't come to a conclusion during class, we can still work it out later.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 3 times a week. Even if we _think_ that we have done everything needed.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Not approval, but rather agreement that this is what we _will_ do for that specific assignment.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Find out the reasoning for that disagreement and try to work around that. If it is not possible, I will ask if he can compromise, and maybe compromise the next time he/she has a better idea.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Confront him on a 1 on 1, and ask him/her politely if it is possible that instead of dominating the process, teach us his ways of going about it.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Ask for help. Saying that this is starting to become an issue for me, and conflict may arrise because of that.
