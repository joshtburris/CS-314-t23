# Teamwork Questionnaire for Kelyn Shaffner

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
    It is easiest by text or email.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
    I am expecting my team will all work together and do really well on the project.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
     My goals are to communicate well with my team because I won't be around for face to face things.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
     Github seems to be an obstacle for me already. I have spent quite some time trying to figure things out.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
     I think we should all aim for an "A" as a team and talk about this at the beginning so we don't argue about it later in the semester.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
     Yes
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
     Probably around 7ish hours. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
     Ask people what they are good at and discuss as a team who can/wants to do what.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
     Ask them what happened and if they need more help with anything.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
     Talk about it and compromise.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
     SCRUM meetings shoule be sufficient.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
     If we need to, yes.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
     Once or twice a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
     As long as the majority votes for it, I think just about anything should be fine.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
     Again, I think a majority vote seems good. The one person will have to get over it.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
     Ask if there is anything I could do to help.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
     Ask the team for more help with whatever it is I need.
